The library may be linked with a long lived process, such as a service, where it can load the enclaves and leave them loaded (persistent). This better ensures that the enclaves will be available upon quote requests and not subject to EPC limitations if loaded on demand. However, if the Quoting library is linked with an application process, there may be many applications with the Quoting library and a better utilization of EPC is to load and unloaded the quoting enclaves on demand (ephemeral).  The library will be shipped with a default policy of loading enclaves and leaving them loaded until the library is unloaded (PERSISTENT). If the policy is set to EPHEMERAL, then the QE and PCE will be loaded and unloaded on-demand.  If either enclave is already loaded when the policy is change to EPHEMERAL, the enclaves will be unloaded before returning."],["sgx_qv_set_path","Set the full path of QVE and QPL library.
